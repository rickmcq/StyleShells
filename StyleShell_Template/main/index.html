	<h1>Hello, Style Shell!</h1>

	<p>
		<b style="color:red;font-size:150%;">ROUGH DRAFT -- WORK IN PROGRESS</b> -- Ver 0.2 -- 5/22/2023 -- RMcQ -- rick@mcqcorp.com -- 310-947-1769

	<h2>The Problem</h2>

	How does a website creative team deliver all the creative artifacts (files, etc.) for a custom-designed website that is not based on WordPress (or Wix, or SquareSpace, etc.)?

	<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>

	<p>
		Use this Style Shell! The Style Shell website is an 'empty' website that contains all of a website's branding and styles but no content or function (custom code).
	</p>

	<p>
		The project is used to compose and deliver the site's creative elements
		to the site owner so that they can take over these elements
		and integrate them with the content and function to form the complete site.
	</p>

	<h3>Alternative: Use Git/GitHub</h3>

	TO BE EXPANDED: The creative team could use Git/GitHub to contribute derectly to the ongoing project. 

	<h2>How to Use this Project:</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>(Site Owner) Give a copy of the StyleShell_Template website to your creative team with instructions on how to fill it out with branding and style information.</li>
		<li>(Creative Team) Add all branding and creative work to the template site and deliver it back to the owner as StyleShell_CompanyX.</li>
		<li>(Site Owner) Integrate content and function with the style shell provided.</li>
	</ol>

	NOTE that iterations (updates, versions) can be performed by re-delivering this project. The recipient (site owner) can do a 'diff' to see what's changed and update the 'integrated' site accordingly.

	<h2>Project contents:</h2>

	<h3>Folders and files used in production</h3>

	First, let's get these two BootStrap folders out of the way. BootStrap uses these; do not modify them:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Folder: Content.</b> A BootStrap folder. Do not modify.</li>
		<li><b>Folder: Scripts.</b> A BootStrap folder. Do not modify.</li>
	</ul>

	Next, here are folders that the creative team will contribute their content:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Folder: images.</b> A standard folder to put all images.</li>
		<li>
			<b>Folder: includes.</b> A standard folder to put all css, fonts, and js.
			<ul>
				<li><b>css.</b> Contains all cascading style sheets.</li>
				<li><b>fonts.</b> Contains any font files needed for the style(s) used.
		</li>
		<li><b>js.</b> Contains any javascript needed for the style(s) used.</li>
	</ul>
			NOTE that these folders may contain other files NOT provided by the creative team.
		</li>
		<li><b>Folder: main.</b> A folder that can be used to either hold the main content, or be an entry point to other content.</li>
		<li><b>Folder: media.</b> Used? A standard folder to hold media.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Folders and files NOT used in production</h3>

	The creative team will also contribute content here:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Folder: yDesign.</b> Demos, displays, and palettes of the design elements.	See <a href="../yDesign/_ReadMe.txt" target="_blank">ReadMe.txt</a> <a href="../yDesign/_ReadMe.md" target="_blank">ReadMe.md</a> <a href="../yDesign/_ReadMe.htm" target="_blank">ReadMe.htm</a>.</li>
		<li><b>Folder: yInstructions.</b> How to use this template site.					See <a href="../yInstructions/_ReadMe.txt" target="_blank">ReadMe</a>.</li>
		<li><b>Folder: yTemplates.</b> Starter pages.										See <a href="../yTemplates/_ReadMe.txt" target="_blank">ReadMe</a>.</li>
	</ul>
